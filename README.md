# Markdown link parser


I started writing articles for my blog 
At the end of every article I write, I want a list of the links in the article
The article will be written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

I want to make a tool which will automagically do this for me everytime I write an article, maybe linking it with the `hugo` build command which builds my site.

Since [hugo](http://gohugo.io/) is written in [Go](http://golang.org/), I'll write the code in [Go](http://golang.org/) too.

This file aka the README file will be used to test the parser

[] - The first step will be to print the links in a Markdown file to stdout 

[] - then they can be appended to the file

[] - then I can figure out how to incorporate it into the build process, find out how "draft: bool" works

[] - then they I can add some condition to the frontmatter, i.e. "appendlinks: bool", to toggle the behaviour

### A markdown parser: [Blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday)

Internally, hugo also uses this package to translate markdown into html.

[hugo docs content management section](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/)

### Sidenote: A package manager

Up until now I have relied on the `go get` command for all my go projects, but since I'm going to publish this code, I wanted to use a tool like pip or npm for dependency management. [Dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/) is an equivalent go tool, so I'll give it a try.

- installing Dep with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

```sh
brew install dep
```

- initialising a dep project

```sh
dep init
```

- adding blackfriday as a dependency in `Gopkg.toml`

```toml
required = ["github.com/russross/blackfriday"]
[[constraint]]
  name = "github.com/russross/blackfriday"
  version = "2.0.0"
```

- running dep ensure to install
```sh
dep ensure
```
